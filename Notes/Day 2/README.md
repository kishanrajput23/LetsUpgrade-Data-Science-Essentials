**End Attribute:**                                                                                                                                      

End attribute is python's print() function comes with a parameter called 'end'. By default, the value of this parameter is '\n', i.e. the new line character. You can end a print statement with any character/string using this parameter.

**Range function:**                                                                                                                                  

The range() function returns a sequence of numbers, starting from 0 by default, and increments by 1 (by default), and stops before a specified number. Range function is designed to work in for loop.

**Tuple function:**

Tuple is same as list but it is a collection of dissimilar data types. Whereas list is flexible with "[]" and tuple are fixed in nature "()‚Äù. Tuple are used in Aadhar number or pan number which are never going to change their value.

**Set function:**

Sets are unordered set() method is used to convert any of the iterable to sequence of iterable elements with distinct elements, commonly called Set. Parameters : Any iterable sequence like list, tuple or dictionary. Returns : An empty set if no element is passed.

**Dictionary function:**

Dictionary in Python is an unordered collection of data values, used to store data values like a map, which unlike other Data Types that hold only single value as an element.
